## Exercise

Consider the scalar field

$$
f(x,y) = y^4 + 3x^2 - 4xy - 5y + 81.
$$

Calculate the Hessian matrix at the point $(2,1)$.

## Exercise

Consider the scalar field $f(x,y) = 8 \sin x \sin y$. Calculate the second order Taylor approximation of $f$ at the point $(\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})$.
_Hint: $f(\mathbf{x}) \approx f(\mathbf{aa}) + \nabla f(\mathbf{a}) \cdot (\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{a}) + \frac{1}{2} {(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{a})} \ \mathbf{H} f (\mathbf{a}) \ (\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{a})^{\mathbf{T}}$._

## Exercise

Locate and classify the extrema points of the scalar field

$$
f(x,y) = x^4 + 3 x y + 2 y^2 +1.
$$

## Exercise

Locate and classify the stationary points of the scalar field

$$
f(x,y) = 2x^2 - xy - 3y^2 - 3x +7y +11.
$$

## Exercise

Locate and classify the stationary points of the scalar field

$$
f(x, y, z) = 2e^{(x−1)^2} (y^4 − 4yz + 2z^2).
$$

## Exercise

Find the absolute minimum and absolute maximum of $f(x,y)=(9x^2 − 1)(1 + 4y)$ on the rectangle given by $−2 \leq x \leq 3$, $−1\leq y \leq4$.

## Exercise

Apply the Lagrange multiplier method to find the points on the curve $x^2 + xy + y^2 = 21$ which are closest / furthest to the origin. _Out of curiosity, sketch the curve and identify the extrema points found._

## Exercise

Apply the Lagrange multiplier method to find the points on the curve of intersection of the two surfaces

$$
x^2 - xy + y^2 - z^2 = 4, \quad  \quad x^2 + y^2 =4
$$

which are nearest the origin.

## Exercise

Apply the Lagrange multiplier method to find the extrema of $f(x, y, z) = yz + xy$ subject to the constraints $xy = 1$ and $y^2 + z^2 = 1$.
