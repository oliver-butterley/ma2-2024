## Exercise

Identify the hypothesis and conclusion in the following statements. For the 4th and 5th statements, rewrite them in a way that clarifies which part is hypothesis and which is conclusion.

1. If $x$ is a positive real number that satisfies $x^2 − 2x + 1 < 0$, then $x < 1$.
2. If $x$ is a real number, then either $x \leq 0$, $x \geq 0$.
3. If there exists a real number $x$ such that $x^4 + 1 = 0$, then any real number is either an integer or a
   multiple of $\pi$.
4. The inverse of a irrational number is also irrational.
5. For each $x\in\mathbb{R}$ there exists $y\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $x=y^2$.

## Exercise

The negation of various statements is described in the following table.

| Statement                         | Negation                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| $P$ or $Q$                        | Not $P$ and not $Q$                  |
| $P$ and $Q$                       | Not $P$ or not $Q$                   |
| If $P$, then $Q$                  | $P$ and not $Q$                      |
| For all $x$, $P(x)$               | There exist $x$ such that not $P(x)$ |
| There exists $x$ such that $P(x)$ | For every $x$, not $P(x)$            |

Think of day-to-day examples which illustrate the logic described in this table.

## Exercise

Find the negation of the following statements

1. Some prime numbers are odd.
2. Nobody is lazy.
3. Some horses are black.
4. For every $x\in\mathbb{R}$, $x^2 \geq 0$.
5. There exists $x\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $x^2 = 7$.
6. For each $x\in\mathbb{R}$ there exists $y\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $x=y^2$.
7. If $x,y\geq 0$ then $\sqrt{x}=\sqrt{y}$ implies that $x=y$.

## Exercise

What does each of the following statements mean, and which of them are true?

1. For every positive number $x$, and every positive number $y$, we have $y^2=x$.
2. There exists a positive number $x$ such that for every positive number $y$, we have $y^2=x$.
3. There exists a positive number $x$, and there exists a positive number $y$, such that $y^2=x$.
4. For every positive number $y$, there exists a positive number $x$ such that $y^2=x$.
5. There exists a positive number $y$ such that for every positive number $x$, we have $y^2=x$.

## Exercise

Consider the following statement.

> Let $f$ be differentiable on $(a, b)$ and suppose that $f$ takes a local minimum or maximum at the point $c \in (a, b)$. Then $f^{\prime}(c) = 0$.

Discuss the possibility to improve the statement in the sense of making it stronger. Would this be stronger or weaker conclusion? Would this be a stronger or a weaker hypothesis?
