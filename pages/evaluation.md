# Evaluation

Evaluation is by written exam followed by an oral exam.

> **Note:** This year there are no exercises giving credit, nor midterms, nor projects for this course.

## Written exam

At the end of the course there is a written exam. This will test the course participant's ability for all the parts of the course. Practising exercises for all the topics is the best preparation for the exam.

It is permitted to take up to 4 A4 sheets (or equivalent surface area) of notes to the exam. No electronic devices are permitted in the exam.

During the written exam solutions must be written completely and fully justified.

The written exam consist of two parts, each of 90 minutes duration. Each part consists of 3 questions. After the end of the first part, course participants submit their solutions to that part and we take a 30 minute break before starting the second part.

## Oral exam

The oral exam is obligatory and will be conducted shortly after the written exam. Preparation for the written exam suffices as preparation for the oral. During the oral the course participant is required to show an ability working with the material on par with what they have demonstrated in their exercise set solutions during the semester and the written exam solutions.

Careless errors, etc which have caused a loss of points in the written exam can potentially be recovered during the oral with points being added to the bonus.

The written and oral must be taken in the same call.

## Grades

A grade of 18 or above and is considered as passing the course. The highest grade is 30 Lode.
