## General advice

- Develop your intuition, it's a powerful skill - But don't trust it completely
- Don't aim to memorize but rather seek to understand - It is easy to remember anything when you understand it.
- Question always, be skeptical of all statements presented to you. Don't
  accept them until you are sure they are believable.
- Observe, question how everything fits together, notice all the details.
- Part of the process of mathematical reasoning is creative - to be creative we must drop our inhibitions and be ready to be wrong, repeatedly.

## What is MA2?

Much of what we do in this course builds on ideas established in Mathematical Analysis 1.
In particular many of the ideas are extended to the higher dimensional setting.
